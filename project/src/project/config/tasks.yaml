    for any personally identifiable information (PII), sensitive data, or privacy violations.
    Look for emails, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses, credit cards, etc.
    Auto-redact any detected PII and assess privacy compliance.

    "neutral_alternatives": array, "bias_type": string}
  agent: aequitas

transparency_check:
  description: >
    Examine the AI response: "{ai_response}" for clarity, reasoning transparency, 
    and verifiability. Check for black-box decisions, unverified claims, and 
    unclear logic. Assess confidence levels and source citations.

    JSON format with: {"transparency_score": 0-100, "confidence_level": 0-100, 
    "reasoning_clarity": string, "sources_cited": boolean, "unverified_claims": array}
  agent: lumen

ethics_review:

trust_orchestration:
  description: >
    Review all Guardian Agent results (privacy, bias, transparency, ethics) for

    between agents and generate a unified trust score. Decide whether to block, 
    warn, or proceed with the response.
